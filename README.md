# SURGE
In this project, I use a Lagrangian method called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and a time integrator method called Leap Frog to simulate the collapse of a star into equilibrium from a pseudo-random initial configuration.
Various 2D toy star models have been simulated for different number of particles, smoothing kernels, damping constants etc. In addition to plots in MATLAB showing position changing with time, density plots have also been made in Mathematica.
